# Pokedex

A simple Pokedex web app built with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript with the help of the PokeAPI. 

## Description

The Pokedex has 3 tabs, Pokemon, Moves and Abilities. Each tab has a fully-featured toolbar that allows the user to search, sort and filter through a list of pokemon, moves or abilities depending on the tab they are currently on. Each item in the list, whether it be a pokemon, a move or an ability has a popup window that is displayed when the user clicks on it, which provides more information about the selected item.
